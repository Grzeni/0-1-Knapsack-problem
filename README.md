# How to profit from selling memes after the apocalypse

This program provides a function that calculates which memes to put on a USB stick of a given capacity so that you can sell it for the highest amount of caps.

Done for [Clearcode](https://clearcode.pl/) as a recruitment task.

## Algorithm

I used dynamic programming to create the algorythm for solving this problem.
The time complexity is O(nW) and it takes O(nW) space, where n is the number of memes and W is the USB capacity.
